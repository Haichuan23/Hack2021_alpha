## Inspiration

We gain inspiration mainly from the film Blade Runner. In the film, humans (called “Blade Runners”) try to detect and kill intelligent robots (called replicas) among them, which is exactly what happens in this game. 

Inspired by the classical Blade Runner movie, our game aims to visually demonstrate the breaking down of the boundaries between the human/robot binary, a core concept of the cyberpunk genre. We have two players for the game, one controls the human “hunter”, and the other controls the robot “prey”. The game takes place in a maze. There are magical bottles in our maze which enables the human character to turn herself into a cyborg. As machines surpasses humans in vision and speed, the human character can gain physical advantage in the hunt through turning herself into a cyborg. Meanwhile, there are also magical bottles which enables memory implementation. Memory is the key character which traditionally distinguishes human from machines. (For example, you can remember a childhood experience, but your computer does not have a memory regarding its childhood if the computer indeed has a childhood.) Hence, memory implantation enables the robot to become more “humane”. The procedures described above will lead to an interesting result: at some point of the game, the robot may become more humane than the human character. The logic for the game is that, when two character meet in the maze, the character which more resembles human being will win the game. Since the robot may become more humane, the traditional binary between human and robot is dismantled, and human and machines can no longer be distinguished from each other.

The other inspiration comes from another core idea of the theme “cyberpunk”: with its two core ideas – the dystopian society. In fact, in the modern society, massive amount of our memory is exteriorized into machines. For instance, if you use the navigation system when you are driving a car, you give up your memory of directions to the GPS. As apparatuses like navigation systems become finer in our society, more and more of our memory will be stored into those machines. Deprived of our own memory, people will become passive consumer of the memory the controller imposes on them, thus making the society a controlled one. Meanwhile, because ordinary people will lose their memory about how to live well, they will be deindividualized in our society. Hence, the competition for memory presented in our game is deeply correlated with the dystopian nature of the cyberpunk genre.
